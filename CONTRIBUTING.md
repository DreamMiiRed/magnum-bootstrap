Bug reports, feature requests or code contributions are always very welcome.
To make things easier, here are a few tips:

Reporting bugs, requesting features
-----------------------------------

*   Best way to report bugs and request new features is to use GitHub
    [issues](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap/issues), but you can
    contact me also any other way.

Code contribution
-----------------

*   Building and installing Magnum is described in the [documentation](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building.html).
*   Follow the project coding guidelines. In short -- try to match style of the
    surrounding code and avoid any trailing whitespace. When in doubt, consult
    coding guidelines, which are available also [online](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/coding-style.html).
*   Best way to contribute is by using GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-bootstrap/pulls)
    -- fork the repository and make pull request from feature branch. You can
    also send patches via e-mail or contact me any other way.
*   All your code will be released under license of the project, so make sure
    you and your collaborators (or employers) have no problems with it. While
    Magnum itself and its documentation are licensed under MIT/Expat license,
    all example code is put into public domain (or UNLICENSE), see the
    [COPYING](COPYING) file for details. To keep the bootstrap projects as
    small and as terse as possible, no license header is put into any files.
